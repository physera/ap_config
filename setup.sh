## todo first time setup
# e.g. 
# - generate okta_aws_login_config
# - link .profile to bash profile or zsh profile
# - inspect /etc/hosts


# philosophy of this file is that it should exit with meaningful, helpful error messages
# until the user has configured everything that must be done manually
# e.g. checking for the existence of files
# and possibly linting them

# otherwise it should automate installs, config generation, etc.
