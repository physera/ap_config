This project is intended to be a safe place to version control physera specific scripts around environment setup and tooling, inspired by dotfiles (e.g. https://dotfiles.github.io/, [animate-object/env](https://github.com/animate-object/env))

Right now I ([@animate-object](https://github.com/animate-object)) am intending it for personal use, but as it evolves I'd like to make it generic enough to be a suitable onboarding helper for new engineers. At that point I might rename it something more generic.

For now I've made it public in case any of the scripts here are useful to other folks.

This repository describes physera specific flows but intentionally omits secrets and sensitive information from version control.
